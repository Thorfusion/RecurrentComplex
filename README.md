Recurrent Complex
============

Recurrent complex is using an older version of the jopt library wich causes it to crash with updated version of Thermos and alike.


Patch was made by [EverNife](https://github.com/EverNife)


I just made the compiling working again after forge moved their maven. And extracted the 1.7.10 version of [ivtoolkit on github](https://github.com/Thorfusion/IvToolkit) from the timeline since it was never tagged in git, had to do this after it was removed from forges maven and its a dependency when compiling. Had to recompile ivtoolkit aswell.
Structure mod for Minecraft.
